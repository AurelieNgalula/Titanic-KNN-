# Titanic-KNN-

The aim of this project is to predict the survival of the Titanic's passengers using a nearest neighbour algorithm.
The data used is that provided by the Kaggle competition, and after submission to the competition we arrive at an accuracy of 0.767.

In this project, we address data visualisation, missing value handling, feature selection and modelling.
